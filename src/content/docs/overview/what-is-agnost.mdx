Agnost is an open source GitOps platform running on Kubernetes clusters. It provides a **complete CD solution for building, deploying, and managing applications in a Kubernetes cluster**. In short, you connect your GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket repository and Agnost takes care of building and deploying your app to your Kubernetes cluster when you push new code.

With Agnost, you can deploy any OCI compliant docker image as a container in your Kubernetes cluster. Agnost automates the application image build and deployment steps so that you do not need to define complex build & deploy actions or pipelines.

- **Full control over your infrasctucture.** Agnost helps you manage your own Kubernetes clusters and eliminates the need to use cloud providers and application build & deployment. You have full control over what you consume and how much you pay for your infrastructure.
- **Faster Build & Deployment.** With Agnost, you just need to connect your GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket repository and it takes care of build and deployment. You do not need to spend hours to configure your build and deployment pipelines.
- **Flexible configuration tuning.** You have several customization options to fine tune your containers in Agnost clusters. We provide editing Kubernetes pod configuration and autoscaling options through a user friendly UI (a.k.a Agnot Studio) and with a few click you can easily customize your deployments, no need to edit yaml files.
- **Built in templates to easily spin up resources.** We provide several templates that you can use to easily spin up databases, key-value storage or object storage solutions in your clusters.
