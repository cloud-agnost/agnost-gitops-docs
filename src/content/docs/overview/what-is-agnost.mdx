Agnost is an open-source GitOps platform running on Kubernetes clusters. It provides a **complete CD solution for building, deploying, and managing applications in a Kubernetes cluster**. In short, you connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository, and when you push new code, Agnost builds and deploys your app to your Kubernetes cluster.

With Agnost, you can deploy any OCI-compliant Docker image as a container in your Kubernetes cluster. Agnost automates the application image build and deployment steps so you do not need to define complex build and deploy actions or pipelines.

- **Full control over your infrastructure.** Agnost helps you manage your Kubernetes clusters and eliminates the need to use cloud providers and application build & deployment. You have full control over what you consume and how much you pay for your infrastructure.
- **Faster Build & Deployment.** With Agnost, you need to connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository, and it takes care of build and deployment. You do not need to spend hours to configure your build and deployment pipelines.
- **Flexible configuration tuning.** You have several customization options to fine-tune your containers in Agnost clusters. We provide editing Kubernetes pod configuration and autoscaling options through a user-friendly UI (a.k.a Agnost Studio). With a few clicks, you can easily customize your deployments without editing yaml files.
- **Built-in templates to easily spin up resources.** We provide several templates that you can use to easily spin up databases, key-value storage, or object storage solutions in your clusters.
