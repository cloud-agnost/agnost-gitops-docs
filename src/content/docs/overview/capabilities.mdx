You can do much with Agnost, from build and deployment automation to networking and autoscaling. Here are some of the key features of Agnost:
- **Integration with [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com).** You can connect your git repo to your container in your Kubernetes cluster, and whenever you push new code, Agnost pulls the code, builds the docker image, and deploys it. 
- **Building docker images.** Under the hood, we use [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) task runs and [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) to build container images from a Dockerfile. Through Agnost Studio, you can monitor build status and access build logs.
- **Deploy docker images.** If you connect your git repo to your container in your cluster, Agnost will automatically handle the build and deployment. Additionally, you can also deploy publicly available Docker images through Agnost Studio.
- **Flexible networking settings.** Agnost can automatically generate a subdomain-based ingress for your containers, or you can define your custom domain to expose your application services to the outside world. You can also enable/disable TCP proxying to connect your containers through a dedicated port.
- **TLS certificates and wildcard domains.** Not only a standard domain, but you can also define wildward subdomains for your containers, and Agnost automatically handles the TLS certificate issue and renewal.
- **One-click deployment using built-in templates.** Agnost has predefined templates for commonly used open-source platforms such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Redis, Memcached, and Minio. You can easily deploy your database, cache, or object storage with one click.
