There is so much that you can do with Agnost from build and deployment automation to networking and autoscaling. Here are some of the key features of Agnost:
- **Integration with [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com).** You can connect your git repo to your container in your Kubernetes cluster and whenever you push new code, Agnost pulls the code, builds the docker image and deploys it. 
- **Building docker images.** Under the hood we use [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) task runs and [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) to build container images from a Dockerfile. Through Agnost Studio you can monitor build status and access to build logs.
- **Deploy docker images.** If you connect your git repo to your container in your cluster, Agnost will automatically handle the build and deployment. Additionally, you can also deploy publicly available Docker images through Agnost Studio.
- **Flexible networking settings.** For your containers, Agnost can automatically generate a subdomain based ingress or you can define your own custom domain to expose your application services to the outside world. Additionally you can also enable/disable TCP proxying so that you can connect your containers through a dedicated port.
- **TLS certificates and wildcard domains.** Not only a standard domain but you can als define wildward subdomins for your containers and Agnost automatically handles the TLS certificate issue and renewal.
- **One click deployment using build-in templates.** Agnost comes with predefined templates for commonly used open-source platforms such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Redis, Memcached and Minio. With one click you can easily deploy your database, cache or object storage.
